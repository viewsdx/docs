# Scope properties

Setting one or multiple conditions on a block will define the way it will render.
There are two ways you can take advantage of the scopes on any given block:

1.  To control how a block looks like when rendered in the view
2.  To show or hide a block from the view

Scopes are defined in the logic files, back-end, or via service call.
Each scope depends on the value passed to respective slot.

General syntax rules:

1.  `when` the `<conditionName` is true, display
2.  `<!props.conditionName` is a negation of the value passed to the slot
3.  There is a base scope which includes all the properties of the block without
    leading `when` statement.
4.  Properties included in each scope have to also be used in the base scope
    with a default value.

## Control properties of blocks dynamically

Blocks and Views can have many scopes driven by `when` statements.
Basic example:

```views
Button Vertical
  backgroundColor white
  onClick <
  when <isClicked
  backgroundColor green
  Label Text
    color black
    text Click me
    when <isClicked
    color white
    text I was clicked
```

This comes handy when you want to change a block on interaction, or when you
want to animate transitions.

There is a specific structure to a block with `when` properties.

Styling properties positioned directly below the name, and type, of a block become the
base style. They can be changed based on passed slot conditions. From the example above:
`when <isClicked` is a condition added to the Button wrapping the Text block.
Above this `when` condition, and as a part of base style, you can position any
styling properties, we use `backgroundColor white`.

Below the `when` condition you can overwrite the conditions from the base styles.
We change background color of the button to `green` using `backgroundColor green`.

There can be any number of the `when` conditions within the block you need.
After adding properties below each `when`, remember to add it also to the base
style with a default value.

`when` conditions can be triggered on any basic blocks and custom views.
The `when` property doesn't have to be passed down to the custom view manually.
It will apply automatically. So, this is also valid even though Title view doesn't
have the `when <when` specified anywhere within the view.

```views
Button Vertical
  backgroundColor white
  onClick <
  when <isClicked
  backgroundColor green
  Label Text
    color black
    text Click me
    when <isClicked
    color white
    text I was clicked
  SubTitle
    marginTop 5
    text Go for it!
    when <isClicked
    text Nicely done!
```

The `SubTitle` view is saved as `SubTitle.view` file and contains on `Text` block
with `text` defined as external slot.

```views
SubTitle Text
  color #ffaa00
  fontFamily Montserrat
  fontSize 16
  marginTop < 10
  text < my text
```

As you see, there is no `when` props in the `Subtitle` view but the `text` values
are changing based on the `isClicked` condition specified in `Button.view` file.
By default `when` will get `true` value and will create a new artboard in Views Tools.

Here's the visual result of the conditions above :

## Hover states

You also use a `when` condition to apply hover states.

```
CloseButton Vertical
  backgroundColor white
  when <isHovered
  backgroundColor blue
```

## Control when blocks are rendered/shown

You can use `onWhen` condition as part of the base scope to act as a rendering
switch, and show or hide the block.

```views
Popup Text
onWhen <goesYoohoo
  text Yoohoo!
```

At this point slot `<goesYoohoo` expects a boolean value and can be set
as true or false in the state of the `.view.logic.js` file.

If you use Views Tools you will see two artboards in the preview with Popup block
shown in the first one and not visible in the second, because by default `onWhen`
get's `false` value (or strictly `undefined`).

The Popup will be rendered in the view of the final production build based on the
value of the `<goesYoohoo` passed from the `Popup.view.logic.js` file, from
the back-end, or via an API call. By default the Popup will not render.

## To avoid errors, make sure your fake props comply with these simple rules:

1.  Always start the scope name with a `when`
2.  The name of the scope can have spaces, but not special characters like dashes or parenthesis.

## Javascript ternaries and props are no longer supported

With the simplification of `when` conditions, ternaries like:
`text props.isClicked ? 'Nicely done!' : 'Go for it!'`
are no longer supported.

With the introduction of slots, props are no longer supported (specifically from
the morpher version 12.0.0)
