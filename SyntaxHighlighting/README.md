# Syntax highlighting

We’ve created the following packages to help you understand `.view` files better:

* [Atom](http://atom.io/packages/language-views),
* [Sublime](https://github.com/viewstools/syntax-sublime),
* [VIM](https://github.com/viewstools/syntax-vim), and
* [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=uxtemple.views).

We currently highlight block names, numbers, props, and strings. Our highlighters
aren’t perfect, but they should get us started. Feel free to submit fixes and suggestions!

If you’re using other editors and come up with a syntax highlighter for it, reach out,
and we’ll add it to this list.

Happy editing!
