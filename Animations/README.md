# Animate scopes

Each Block has at least one scope, the base scope.

Other, conditional scopes are described in detail below. It’s important to distinguish them though and to keep in mind that if the prop is missing from the base scope, it will not affect the conditional scope.

```views
Vertical
backgroundColor red - the start of the base scope
width 100
height 100 - the end of the base scope 
when <isHovered - the second condition
backgroundColor blue - the start of the first conditional scope
height 50 - the end of the first conditional scope
when <isSelected - the second condition
backgroundColor black - the second conditional scope
```
A Block can have an unlimited number of conditional scopes. The order of those matters tho as the code is executed top to bottom.

## Types of conditional scopes

* isHovered
* isFocused
* isPlaceholder
* isMediaMobile
* isMediaTablet
* isMediaDesktop
* isMediaLaptop
* isBefore

Example of an on View load fade animation with isBefore condition. 

```views
App View
  Vertical
  opacity 1
  when <isBefore
  opacity 0 linear
    Text
     text hey
     color black
     when <isBefore
     color red
```
Many blocks within the same View can share the same condition, as shown in the example above.

## Add animations to properties

Say we want to animate the `width` of a simple button:

![ButtonAnimatedWidth](../images/ButtonAnimatedWidth.gif)

```
Button Vertical
backgroundColor red
onClick <
width 100
  Label Text
  text Hi
```

First we need to add a condition (scope) to the Vertical. Animations
can be only triggered when the condition value changes (true/false):

```
Button Vertical
backgroundColor red
onClick <
width 100
when <isClicked
width 150
  Label Text
  text Hi
```

Animations work on scopes and require base value on the base scope.
You can think of scopes as animation frames.

Base scope is always a starting frame and each scope defines next frame.

This wouldn't work (there is no width property on the base scope):

```
Button Vertical
## (base scope starts)
backgroundColor red
onClick <
## (base scope ends, isClicked scope starts)
when <isClicked
width 150
## (isClicked scope ends)
  Label Text
  text Hi
```

Add name of the curve after the value to animate any animatable property.
We want to animate `width` after the button is clicked, so we add `spring` after width's value in the `isClicked` scope:

```
ButtonAnimatedWidth Vertical
backgroundColor red
onClick <
width 100
when <isClicked
width 150 spring
  Label Text
  text Hi
```

Here's the code auto-generated by the Morpher from the ButtonAnimatedWidth.view file.
[ButtonAnimatedWidth.view.logic.js](ButtonAnimatedWidth.view.logic.js)

## Animation curves

![EaseAll](../images/ExAll.gif)

### Spring

![Spring curve](../images/animationCurvesSpring.jpg)

`tension` is the spring energetic load (default `170`).
`friction` is the spring resistance (default `26`).

Syntax examples:

* `width 150 spring`
* `paddingLeft 20 spring tension 20`
* `marginTop 10 spring tension 20 friction 20`
* `translateY 10 spring tension 20 friction 20 delay 300`

Configuration examples:

![Spring default](../images/ExSpring1A.gif)

![Spring 2](../images/ExSpring2A.gif)

![Spring 3](../images/ExSpring3a.gif)

![Spring 4](../images/ExSpring4.gif)

![Spring 5](../images/ExSpring5.gif)

### EaseIn

No maximum. Default duration 150.

Syntax examples:

* `width 150 easeIn`
* `paddingLeft 20 easeIn duration 300`
* `translateX 20 easeIn duration 300 delay 300`

Configuration examples:

![EaseIn curve1](../images/ExEaseIn1.gif)

![EaseIn curve2](../images/ExEaseIn2.gif)

![EaseIn curve3](../images/ExEaseIn3.gif)

### EaseOut

No maximum. Default duration 150.

Syntax examples:

* `height 150 easeOut`
* `left 20 easeOut duration 300`
* `scale 20 easeOut duration 300 delay 300`

Configuration examples:

![EaseOut curve1](../images/ExEaseOut1.gif)

![EaseOut curve2](../images/ExEaseOut2.gif)

![EaseOut curve3](../images/ExEaseOut3.gif)

### Ease

No maximum. Default duration 150.

Syntax examples:

* `rotate 150 ease`
* `bottom 20 ease duration 300`
* `translateY 20 ease duration 300 delay 300`

Configuration examples:

![Ease curve1](../images/ExEase1.gif)

![Ease curve2](../images/ExEase2.gif)

![Ease curve3](../images/ExEase3.gif)

### Linear

No maximum. Default duration 150.

Syntax examples:

* `maxWidth 150 linear`
* `right 20 linear duration 300`
* `flexGrow 3 linear duration 300 delay 300`

Configuration examples:

![Linear curve1](../images/ExLinear1.gif)

![Linear curve2](../images/ExLinear2.gif)

![Linear curve3](../images/ExLinear3.gif)

## Delay

Add `delay` to any animated property with a milliseconds value, like in the examples above.

In the Hurray button we are delaying the padding's animation:

```
paddingLeft 100 easeOut delay 500
paddingRight 100 easeOut delay 500
```

![Delay](../images/delay1.gif)

## List of all animated properties

In general, all the numerical value properties can be animated.

### Animatable Layout props

* width
* height
* maxWidth
* maxHeight
* minWidth
* minHeight
* flexGrow (wow!)
* bottom
* top
* left
* right

### Animatable Spacing props

All margins and paddings can be animated! Make something fancy ⭐️!

### Animatable Color props

Animations work on color, backgroundColor, and opacity, including spring curves 🤩. Funky!

![Color Spring Animation](../images/animationColorSpring.gif)

### Animatable Transform props

* scale
* translateX
* translateY
* rotate

### Animatable Border props

* borderWidth
* borderColor
* all border radius props
* outlineColor
* outlineWidth

## Combine animated properties

You can animate more than one property in a block, although you will get the best
results if you will use only one spring animation per block.

![ButtonBounce](../images/ButtonBounce.gif)

Here we are animating:

* scale
* backgroundColor
* paddingLeft
* paddingRight

```
ButtonBounce Horizontal
alignItems center
backgroundColor #ffaa00
borderBottomLeftRadius 5
borderBottomRightRadius 5
borderTopLeftRadius 5
borderTopRightRadius 5
justifyContent center
onClick <
paddingBottom 10
paddingLeft 20
paddingRight 20
paddingTop 10
scale 1
when <isClicked
backgroundColor #00c276 linear
paddingLeft 100 easeIn
paddingRight 100 easeIn
scale 1.5 spring tension 20
  Text
  color #ffffff
  fontFamily Montserrat
  fontSize 18
  fontWeight 400
  text Click Me
  when <isClicked
  fontFamily Lobster
  fontSize 28 linear
  text Hurray!!!
```

As you can see the text also changes when condition `isClicked` get's toggled on.
Same goes for animations. You can animate many properties across blocks
and scopes.

Side note. Any interactive blocks need some sort of logic to make them fully functional.
Here's an example of the logic file we've used in our animated example. Save it together
with the `ButtonBounce.view` file.
[ButtonBounce.view.logic.js](ButtonBounce.view.logic.js)

## Transitions, lists, loops, and Tools

We still need to use JavaScript to animate transitions between views.
Here's an example of a function used in a logic file that does the trick for now.
Transitions and loops will be added to the next major release. 😊

We are also working on animating list's items. Here's an example of what's
possible today using Javascript in the logic file.

Views Tools beta will support props animations!

## Known issues - work in progress

* There can be only one spring animation in the view
* EaseInOut curve has a bug and currently doesn't work
* delay on spring curves doesn't work
