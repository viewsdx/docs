## Views is a creative toolset for professional product teams

* Views Framework is our response to the complexities and silos we see and experience every day in the software delivery process
* We're trying to simplify development to make it more inclusive for non-developers
* We achieve simplicity through smart automation and carefully designed creative constraints
* We noticed that when designers and product owners have access to the code-base the quality of the final solution is higher
* Better collaboration enables knowledge transfer, designers become better at engineering and engineers better at design
* Faster delivery and shared responibility lower the risk of faluire

We don't have everything figured out yet, but [the things we've done](https://design.views.tools/) up to now give us high confidence towards the future.

## Direct benefits of Views

* Consistent and predictable state,¬†
* Easy front-end code for everyone on the team to contribute to,
* Separation of concerns between layout and logic,
* Full engineering flexibility,
* Portable patterns.
